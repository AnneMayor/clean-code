# Unit Test
- Isolate my code from the operating system rather than just calling the standard timing functions
- mock out those timing functions so that I had absolute control over the time.
- schedule commands that set boolean flags, and then I would step the time forward, watching
those flags and ensuring that they went from false to true just as I changed the time to the
right value.
- Once I got a suite of tests to pass, I would make sure that those tests were convenient
to run for anyone else who needed to work with the code. 
- I would ensure that the tests and the code were checked in together into the same source package.

## The Three Laws of TDD
tip of the iceberg: TDD - write unit tests first, before production code.

`Three Laws` (Cycle)  
- The tests
and the production code are written together, with the tests just a few seconds ahead of the
production code

1 You may not write production code until you have written a failing unit test.

2 You may not write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and not compiling is failing.

3 You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing test.

=> 실패하는 unit test code 작성 -> 해당 코드가 성공할때까지 refactor -> production code

## Keeping Tests Clean 
- you might decide that having dirty tests is better than having no tests
    - having dirty tests is equivalent to, if not worse than, having no tests.
    - production code를 바꾸게 되면 dirty test code를 맞춰 변경하기 어렵다.

- Test suite 없이는 code base가 예상한대로 동작하지 않을 수 있다 = Test suite 없이는 변경한 내용이 시스템의 다른 부분을 망가뜨리지 않을 것임을 확신할 수 없다 -> 변경하기 두려워진다 -> 변경이 이점보다 단점이 많을 것 같아 production code를 깨끗하게 하는 것을 멈춘다 -> production code가 썩는다 -> 결국 마지막엔 test는 없고, 복잡하고 버그가 있는 production code, 혼란스런 고객들, 테스트를 하고자한 노력이 실패한 느낌만 남는다

- Test code is just as important as production code. It must be kept as clean
as production code.
### Tests Enable the -ilities
- Test를 깨끗하게 유지하지 않으면 잃게 된다 -> production code를 `flexible`, `maintainable`, `reusable`하게 유지할 수 없다
    - Tests enable all the -ilities, 
because tests enable change.

- 코드를 얼마나 잘 작성하고 구조를 잘 만들었는지와 상관없이 Test가 없으면 모든 변경사항은 잠재적 버그다
- The higher your test coverage, the less
your fear. 
- The dirtier your tests, the
dirtier your code becomes. Eventually you lose the tests, and your code rots.
## Clean Tests
- What makes a clean test? **Readability**
    - perhaps even more important in unit tests than it is in production code. 
- What makes tests readable? The same thing that makes all code readable: clarity, simplicity,
and density of expression. 
    - In a test you want to say a lot with as few expressions as
possible.
    - eliminate annoying detail
    - use only the data types and functions that they truly need
### Domain-Specific Testing Language
- This testing API is not designed up front; rather it evolves from the continued refactoring of test code that has gotten too tainted by obfuscating detail.  
- Refactor test
code into more succinct and expressive forms.
### A Dual Standard
```java
//from this
@Test
public void turnOnLoTempAlarmAtThreashold() throws Exception {
    hw.setTemp(WAY_TOO_COLD);
    controller.tic();
    assertTrue(hw.heaterState());
    assertTrue(hw.blowerState());
    assertFalse(hw.coolerState());
    assertFalse(hw.hiTempAlarm());
    assertTrue(hw.loTempAlarm());
}

//to this
@Test
public void turnOnLoTempAlarmAtThreshold() throws Exception {
    wayTooCold();
    assertEquals("HBchL", hw.getState());
}
```
- After all, it runs in a test environment, not a production environment, and
those two environment have very different needs.
There are things that you might never do in a
production environment that are perfectly fine in a test environment.
    - ex. issues of memory or CPU efficiency 
- But they never involve issues of cleanliness.
## One Assert per Test 
- test should have one and only one assert statement.
    - ex. splitting the tests as shown results in a lot of duplicate code.. We can eliminate the duplication by using some skills
### Single Concept per Test
- Perhaps a better rule is that we want to test a single concept in each test function.
- Probably the best rule is that you should minimize the number of asserts per concept and test just one concept per test function.
## F.I.R.S.T
Clean tests follow five other rules:  
`Fast` Tests should run quickly. When tests run slow, you won’t want to run them frequently. If you don’t run them frequently, you won’t find problems early enough to fix them easily. You won’t feel as free to clean up the code. => code
will begin to rot.

`Independent` One test should not set up the conditions for the next test. You should be able to run each test independently and run the tests in any order you like.   
When tests depend on each other,  
- the first one to fail causes a cascade of downstream failures
- making diagnosis difficult and hiding downstream defects.

`Repeatable` Should be able to run the
tests in any environment like production environment, QA environment, and on your laptop without a network. If your tests aren’t repeatable in any environment, then you’ll always have an excuse for why they fail. You’ll also find yourself unable to run the tests when the environment isn’t available.

`Self-Validating` The tests should have a boolean output. Either they pass or fail. If the tests aren’t self-validating, then failure can become subjective and running the tests can require a long manual evaluation.

`Timely` Unit tests should be written just
before the production code that makes them pass. If you write tests after the production
code, then you may find the production code to be hard to test. You may decide that some
production code is too hard to test. You may not design the production code to be testable.

## Conclusion
Perhaps Tests are even more important than the production code, because tests preserve and enhance the flexibility, maintainability, and reusability of the production code. 
- Keep your tests constantly clean. 
- Work to make them expressive and succinct. 
- Invent testing APIs that act as domain-specific language that helps you write the tests.
- If you let the tests rot, then your code will rot too. Keep your tests clean.
